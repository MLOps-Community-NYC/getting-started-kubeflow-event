## What is Kubeflow?

Kubeflow is a cloud-native platform for machine learning operations - pipelines, training and deployment.

[Documentation](https://www.kubeflow.org/) - [Code](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow)

Today we will be jumping into the Kubeflow Training Operator!

## What is Kubeflow Training Operator?

[Kubeflow Training Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator) is a Kubernetes-native project for fine-tuning and scalable distributed training of machine learning (ML) models created with various ML frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, XGBoost, MPI, Paddle and others.

Training Operator allows you to use Kubernetes workloads to effectively train your large models via Kubernetes Custom Resources APIs or using Training Operator Python SDK.
