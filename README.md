# Getting Started with Open Source MLOps

Hey everyone 👋

We hope you enjoyed Alex Perlman's intro into contributions.

Now its time to **contribute**! 🎉

1. Form groups of 4 people.
    * Only one person _needs_ to have a laptop.
    * Multiple people can be contributors to one PR - don't worry about not getting credit.
2. Come up with a group name.
3. Read through the [Issues](#1-pick-an-issue) section below - and claim an issue in the spreadsheet for the team.
4. Get contributing!

> 🔥 A number experienced contributors from Capital One are roaming around, and able to jump in and help. Simply raise your hand - and hopefully someone will be free to jump in and help.

> ❓ We also have a slack channel open on the MLOps Community Slack. Feel free to post questions in there too to get help from the community! <br><br>[#nyc-2nd-may-open-source](https://mlops-community.slack.com/archives/C0729RSJY72)<br>If you are yet to join: [Sign up here](https://mlops.community/join/) (Approval may take time)

# Contributing

## 1. Pick an issue

We have three separate themes of issues available today:
* [Code Style](issues/style.md) (🌶 Easier Difficulty)
* [Unit Tests](issues/unit-tests.md) (🌶🌶 Medium Difficulty)
* [Other](issues/other.md) 


1. In your group - decide on whether you want to tackle an easier or a more challenging issue.
1. Go to [this spreadsheet](https://lite.framacalc.org/dulyrft6pc-a78e) and pick an issue in the category you chose.
1. Reserve this issue by putting your teams name in the `Claimed By` column. (This will prevent another team working on the same thing.)
1. Get started as a team. It's ok to be a little lost when starting on an issue 😄


## 2. Create your PR

Once your team have some code to resolve the issue. You are going to need to create a PR into the code base.
