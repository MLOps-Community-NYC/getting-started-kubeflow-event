Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹

We hope you enjoyed Alex Perlman's intro into contributions.

Now its time to **contribute**! ðŸŽ‰

1. Form groups of 4 people.
    * Only one person _needs_ to have a laptop.
    * Multiple people can be contributors to one PR - don't worry about not getting credit.
2. Come up with a group name.
3. Read through the [Issues](#1-pick-an-issue) section below - and claim an issue in the spreadsheet for the team.
4. Get contributing!

> ðŸ”¥ A number experienced contributors from Capital One are roaming around, and able to jump in and help. Simply raise your hand - and hopefully someone will be free to jump in and help.

## 1. Pick an issue

We have three separate themes of issues available today:
* [Code Style](issues/style.md) (ðŸŒ¶ Easier Difficulty)
* [Unit Tests](issues/unit-tests.md) (ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ Medium Difficulty)
* [Other](issues/other.md) 


1. In your group - decide on whether you want to tackle an easier or a more challenging issue.
1. Go to [this spreadsheet](https://lite.framacalc.org/dulyrft6pc-a78e) and pick an issue in the category you chose.
1. Reserve this issue by putting your teams name in the `Claimed By` column. (This will prevent another team working on the same thing.)
1. Get started as a team. It's ok to be a little lost when starting on an issue ðŸ˜„


## 2. Create your PR
